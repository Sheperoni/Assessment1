<h1 style="font-size:140%"><b>About Me</b></h1>
<p style="font-size:120%;font-family:helvetica;margin-left:20px">My name as you would know from the heading is Jackson Shepherd and I live in Western Sydney, Austrlia
where i was born bred. I enjoy playing video games on my Xbox, although I don't get much time to play anymore with my full time job and now studing a
Degree. I also enjoy working on cars and watching the footy (Rugby League) where I follow the West Tigers. I am 18 years of age and after finishing my HSC
last year, I got given an IT assistant role at a club where I continue to work.</pre>

<h2><b>Interests in IT</b></h2>
<pre style="font-size:120%;font-family:helvetica">My interest in IT stem from a love of gaming ay a young age which was quite popular amongst friends who I enjoyed playing online multiplayer games with. 
When I recently gained my job in the IT field (IT Assistant working for a club) I knew it was time to begin studying the course to gain my bachelors degree in IT
to help improve my skills and to further my learning in the information technology world. I have gained just over 6 monthsâ€™ worth of experience by working at my current job 
and by learning a range of different IT related skils such as networking, website development, digital marketing and systems administration.<br>I came to RMIT through the 
recommendations given by Opens University (OUA) after I had looked about studying online as I work full time. Upon recommendation, I investigated further and found that 
RMIT had the online accessibility that I needed to help me begin my career in the IT field.<br>The skills I am expecting to learn all faces of the IT industry 
and be able to apply these skills to my current job, which inlcude systems administration, advanced networking, advanced programming etc. I hope to learn how to run 
and manage an IT site so that I am able to take over my managers role and to further succeed in that job. also hope to learn to communicate with others to organize and 
introduce new programs and skills into my workplace.
