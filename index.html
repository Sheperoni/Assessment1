<h1 style="font-size:140%"><b>About Me</b></h1>
<pre style="font-size:120%;font-family:helvetica">I recently gained a job in the IT field (IT assistant at a club) which has led me to begin my degree in Information Technology. 
I gained an interest in it after working for my current employer for just over 6 months and decided I wanted to learn more about the 
field I also become interested in IT after playing video games at a young age. I wish to gain a job managing information technology 
operations in any business, mainly government jobs.</pre>
