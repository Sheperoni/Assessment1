<h2 style="font-size:140%"><b>About Me</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: left; font-family: helvetica; font-size: 120%; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 50px;">My name as you would know from the heading is Jackson Shepherd and I live in Western Sydney, Australia where I was born bred. I am a throrough Australian and can only speak English. I graduated year 12 in high school in September of 2018 before having completed my HSC and had original plans to study either Construction Management or Information Technology at Western Sydney University before I was offered a job as an IT assistant role in a Catholic club. I enjoy playing video games on many different platforms, mainly Xbox, which is where my first interest in IT began as I was constantly pondering about how certain games are coded and what it takes to create these intricate games. Nowadays, I don't get much time to play anymore with my full time job and beginning to study a Degree in IT. I also enjoy working on cars and watching the footy (Rugby League) where I follow the West Tigers. One interesting fact about me is that I almost made it into the Paramatta Rugby League team when I was 16 years old and Rugby League was a first choice career option.</p>
	
<h3 style=font-size:140%><b>Interests in IT</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 50px; font-size:120%;font-family:helvetica;">My interest in IT stem from a love of gaming at a young age which was quite popular amongst friends who I enjoyed playing online multiplayer games with. 
When I recently gained my job in the IT field (IT Assistant working for a club) I knew it was time to begin studying the course to gain my bachelors degree in IT
to help improve my skills and to further my learning in the information technology world. I have gained just over 6 monthsâ€™ worth of experience by working at my current job and by learning a range of different IT related skils such as networking, website development, digital marketing and systems administration.
    <br>
    <br>I came to RMIT through the recommendations given by Opens University (OUA) after I had looked about studying online as I work full time. Upon recommendation, I investigated further and found that RMIT had the online accessibility that I needed to help me begin my career in the IT field.
<br>
<br>The skills I am expecting to learn all faces of the IT industry and be able to apply these skills to my current job, which inlcude systems administration, advanced networking, advanced programming etc. I hope to learn how to run and manage an IT site so that I am able to take over my managers role and to further succeed in that job. also hope to learn to communicate with others to organize and introduce new programs and skills into my workplace.
