<h1>My Test Results</h1>

<h2>Myer-Briggs Test</h2>
<img src="entertainer.PNG" alt="MB Results" style="width:300px; height:500px" align="left">
<p style="margin-left: 25%; text-align: left">The Myers-Briggs test gave me the ESFP-T result which means that I am playful, enthusiastic, friendly, spontaneous, tactful, flexible. Have strong communication sense, enjoy helping people in tangible ways. I believe that these results mean that I am able to encourage others to participate in the excitement of the moment and to feel this the way I do. As ESFP or ‘entertainer’, we are able to include others into the group or team work as we are friendly and enthusiastic which would go far in helping the team work together well and complete tasks to our full potential. I believe the ability to begin friendships with others and to motivate them with the same enthusiasm that this personality have should be taken into consideration when forming a group. This is because I can easily form groups with different types of people with different types of personalities, which can help the group gel together and complete tasks to the highest standard possible.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 42%">Learning Style Test</h2>
<img src="learningstyleresults.PNG" alt="Learning Style Results" align="right">
<p style="text-align: left; margin-right: 10%">The results of an online learning style test determined that I am a visual learner. A visual learner is someone who best learns, understands and remembers things by sight. I can picture what I am learning in my head and I prefer to see what I am learning to further benefit me and to help me understand certain things better, through either pictures or by reading. Being a visual learner in a team environment can be a little challenging as it is difficult to understand certain things because there are more team members that need to learn through their own style. This means that there is less attention on myself being able to read or see certain images as they need to be shared with other members of the team. I believe I should take this into account as I will need to understand and learn things in a different manner to everyone else and I will need more attentiveness to make sure that I am absorbing all the information necessary. Being in groups with other visual learners would benefit as there is someone else in the group who can understand the style of learning so we can pair together to try to bounce of one another to understand what we are learning</p>
    
<h2>Test of  my Choosing</h2>
<h3>(Big 5 Personality Test)</h3>
<img src=personalityresults.PNG alt="Personality Results" style="width:400px; height:272px" align=left>
<p style="text-align: left">This particular personality test gave me the highest rating in agreeableness. They have defined the agreeableness category to be one that puts others before themselves and to cooperate with others rather than fight against others. People who fit in the agreeableness category are very empathetic and they get pleasure out of helping others and taking care of them. Being agreeable in my opinion would be a great member to have in a group as we are easy going and are able to decide on what would be best for the group as well as working in unity with others to reach the end goal. This should be considered as this personality type is able to mix in with the group well which has a positive effect on the group and the work that needs to be completed</p>
